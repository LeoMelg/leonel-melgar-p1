            <h2>Our mission</h2>
                <p>Every year, <em><b>thousands</b></em> of pets across the united states are abandoned or <b>abused</b>. The reasons for this vary, but yet we can all agree that these 
                    animals that can't fend for themselves deserve a better life. Here at Shelter for Helpers our mission is to change the life of an animal that has
                    suffered in any sort of way. </p>
            <h3>Our Beginnigs</h3>
                <p>We were founded in Milwaukee, by a dashing young man with big aspirations and an even bigger heart. Over the course of the years, 
                    we have expanded to multiple states. In the future we hope to expand to all of the country and branch out to other countries. Our main target for expansion is
                    Latin America where there is a <b>big</b> need. 
                </p>
